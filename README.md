# popping-colors
A simple game where you pop circles of different colors. It is mainly made with HTML and CSS, but there is some JS to enhance the functionality of the game.

This idea came from when I made [bobbing colors](https://github.com/Yoda-Flash/bobbing-colors), which consisted of different blobs of different colors bobbing around on a page, leading me to the idea of making that a game where these circles are "popped," hidden and shown in order to gain points.
